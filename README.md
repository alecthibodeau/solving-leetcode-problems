# Solving LeetCode Problems

This repository is a chronicle of my time spent unwinding with LeetCode problems. I enjoy these bite-sized challenges because my typical work day in Angular 2+ or React Native often involves addressing complex and overlapping issues in JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/JSX and styling. Solving narrowly-focused tasks is a fun, short-form way of keeping my vanilla JavaScript skills limber.

I write each problem in its own dedicated JavaScript file, running the code in my local terminal with Node.js to preview the solution before submitting it at LeetCode. There are multiple ways to solve these problems, which means the Runtime Distribution and Memory Distribution for my solutions will differ from those of other successful submissions.
