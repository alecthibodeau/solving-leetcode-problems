# Solving LeetCode Problems

This repository is a chronicle of my time spent unwinding with LeetCode problems. I enjoy these bite-sized challenges because my typical workday involves addressing complex and overlapping issues in React (JSX, TypeScript) and managing styling with Sass and CSS. Solving narrowly-focused tasks in vanilla JavaScript is a fun way to practice the language's fundamentals.

I write each problem in its own dedicated `.js` file, running the code in my local terminal with Node.js to preview the solution before submitting it at LeetCode. There are multiple ways to solve these problems, which means the Runtime and Memory results for my solutions will differ from those of other successful submissions.
