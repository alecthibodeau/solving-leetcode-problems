# Solving LeetCode Problems

This is a chronicle of my time spent unwinding with LeetCode problems.
I enjoy these bite-sized challenges because my typical work day in Angular 2+ or React Native
often involves addressing relatively complex and overlapping issues in JavaScript/TypeScript,
HTML/JSX and styling. Solving narrowly-focused LeetCode problems is a fun, short-form way of keeping my
vanilla JavaScript skills limber.

I write each problem in in its own dedicated JavaScript file. In this way I'm able to
run the code in my local terminal with Node.js, previewing the solution before submitting it on the LeetCode site.
There are multiple ways to solve these problems. As such the Runtime Distribution and Memory Distribution for my
solutions will differ from other successful submissions on the site. I don't log those results here, preferring to concentrate
on the code itself.
